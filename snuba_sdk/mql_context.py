    The MQL string alone is not enough to fully describe a query.
    This class contains all of the additional information needed to
    execute a metrics query in snuba.

    It should be noted that this class is used as an intermediary encoding
    class for data in the the MetricsQuery class that can't be encoded into
    MQL. As such it shouldn't be used directly by users of the SDK.

    This also means that the validation here is quite loose, since this object
    should be created exclusively from a valid MetricsQuery object.
